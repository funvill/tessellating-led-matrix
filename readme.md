I used these two tutorials to help me generate this design

- [Fusion 360: Design a 3D Printed Lampshade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnKBSOulwo)
- [Fusion 360 - Vase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAiG0uTcnSs)

This project is based on work done by [Herschel Shapiro](https://herschelshapiro.com/) and [Matt Shlian](https://www.mattshlian.com/)

- The top is smaller in height, with thinner walls. No overhang. Didn't put a direction on it so it can be oriented in any direction.

**Good** - The base looks good. Wires fit in the holes provided. The LED pixels fit in the spots created. 6 sides looks like it will provide some interesting arrangements. Solid Base.

**Bad** - Too heavy. Too much material. The walls on the top are too thick. Light doesn't reach the very tip of the top.
