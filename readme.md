I used these two tutorials to help me generate this design

- [Fusion 360: Design a 3D Printed Lampshade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnKBSOulwo)
- [Fusion 360 - Vase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAiG0uTcnSs)

This project is based on work done by [Herschel Shapiro](https://herschelshapiro.com/) and [Matt Shlian](https://www.mattshlian.com/)

Using the following LEDS

## Change Log

|              | V2     | V1       |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Filament** | 32.30g | 54.28g   |
| **Time**     | 1h 52m | 2h 43min |

### (2024-Feb-25) GlowingMatrix-v2-2024-Feb-25.step

- The top is smaller in height, with thinner walls. No overhang. Didn't put a direction on it so it can be oriented in any direction.

### (2024-Jan-07) GlowingMatrix-v1-2024-jan-08.step

**Good** - The base looks good. Wires fit in the holes provided. The LED pixels fit in the spots created. 6 sides looks like it will provide some interesting arrangements. Solid Base.

**Bad** - Too heavy. Too much material. The walls on the top are too thick. Light doesn't reach the very tip of the top.
