I used these two tutorials to help me generate this design

- [Fusion 360: Design a 3D Printed Lampshade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnKBSOulwo)
- [Fusion 360 - Vase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAiG0uTcnSs)

This project is based on work done by [Herschel Shapiro](https://herschelshapiro.com/) and [Matt Shlian](https://www.mattshlian.com/)
